      answer: (
        <span>
          Visiting the salon is always a better idea and we will recommend it if
          it is near your place. This is because home service may be more
          expensive, say <strong>40%</strong> to <strong>75%</strong> more.
          Secondly, the makeup artists can do a better job in a setting they are
          used to with all the equipment and make-up items handy. You can also
          go for freelance bridal makeup artists who carry everything from
          Makeup kit to makeup lights at the location. They usually have a head
          artist and assistants like hairstylist.

      question: 'Which one is better Airbrush makeup or Hd-makeup?',
      answer:
        'Both are good and your choice depends on various factors like skin type and budget. Air brush is for those with oily skin whereas HD make-up is suitable for all skin types. Airbrush makeup is a lightweight makeup applied with an airgun. A special kind of silicone based liquid foundation is poured into the small chamber of the airgun and sprayed on the bride’s face. As the trigger is pressed, a mist of foundation covers the face to give a flawless finish and the makeup blends perfectly with the skin. However, airbrush makeup may not be able to hide the flaws 100% and some manual fixing is required by professionals. Also, HD makeup is better for contouring and highlighting. If you have blemishes and acne spots, HD makeup is suggested.'
